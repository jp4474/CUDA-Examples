RaneLab's CUDA Documentations
===================================

**CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing, an approach known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). The CUDA platform is designed to work with programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.
